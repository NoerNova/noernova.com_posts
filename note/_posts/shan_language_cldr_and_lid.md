- Unicode Standard: Unicode is a standard for encoding, representing, and handling text in digital form. It assigns unique code points (integer values) to every character in a wide range of writing systems, including alphabets, ideograms, and symbols.

- Unicode Language Identifier (ULI): Unicode Language Identifier (ULI) is a string that identifies a language or language family in a Unicode environment. It typically consists of a two-letter ISO 639 language code, optionally followed by a two-letter ISO 3166 country code. For example, "en" represents English, "fr" represents French, "zh" represents Chinese.

  - To represent identifier for Shan language, there is no included ISO 639-1 for Shan language but three-letter ISO 639-2 code as ["Shn"](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/langcodes_name.php?code_ID=399)

  - ISO 639-1 code "sh" is assigned to Serbo-Croatian language, which is a collective term for several closely related South Slavic languages spoken in the Balkans. However, the code "sh" is also used for Shan language, which is a Tai-Kadai language spoken in Myanmar, Thailand, and China.

  - ISO 639-2 There're 2 interested identifier, ["shn"](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/langcodes_name.php?code_ID=436) and ["tai"](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/langcodes_name.php?code_ID=436)
    - "shn" is identifier for Shan language and it's type is "Living Language"
    - "tai" is identifier for Tai language and it's type is "Collective"
    - "tai" is used for remainder group language for "Ka-Tai" language group

#### Conclusion refer to Unicode Language Identifier (ULI) document

- for Shan language we can use 2 identifier
  - shn-MM for Shan language spoken in Myanmar
  - shn-TH for Shan language spoken in Thailand
    - **because those are 2 countries mostly spoken in Shan**
    - Unicode Language Identifier (ULI) is used for help identify the language used in a document or application
