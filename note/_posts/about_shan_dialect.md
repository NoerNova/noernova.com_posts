## [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_language#Dialects)

The Shan dialects spoken in [Shan State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_State "Shan State") can be divided into three groups, roughly coinciding with geographical and modern administrative boundaries, namely the northern, southern, and eastern dialects. Dialects differ to a certain extent in vocabulary and pronunciation, but are generally mutually intelligible.

While the southern dialect has borrowed more [Burmese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_language "Burmese language") words, eastern Shan is somewhat closer to [Northern Thai language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Thai_language "Northern Thai language") and [Lao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_language "Lao language") in vocabulary and pronunciation, and the northern so-called "[Chinese Shan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_Nuea_language "Tai Nuea language")" is much influenced by the Yunnan-Chinese dialect.[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]

A number of words differ in initial consonants. In the north, initial /k/, /kʰ/ and /m/, when combined with certain vowels and final consonants, are pronounced /tʃ/ (written _ky_), /tʃʰ/ (written _khy_) and /mj/ (written _my_). In Chinese Shan, initial /n/ becomes /l/. In southwestern regions /m/ is often pronounced as /w/. Initial /f/ only appears in the east, while in the other two dialects it merges with /pʰ/.

[J. Marvin Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Marvin_Brown "J. Marvin Brown") divides the three dialects of Shan State as follows:[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_language#cite_note-3)

1. Northern — [Lashio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lashio "Lashio"), Burma; contains more Chinese influences
2. Southern — [Taunggyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taunggyi "Taunggyi"), Burma (capital of [Shan State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_State "Shan State")); contains more Burmese influences
3. Eastern — [Kengtung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kengtung "Kengtung"), Burma (in the [Golden Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_(Southeast_Asia) "Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)")); closer to Northern Thai and Lao

Prominent divergent dialects are considered separate languages, such as [Khün](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh%C3%BCn_language "Khün language") (called Kon Shan by the Burmese), which is spoken in [Kengtung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kengtung_Township "Kengtung Township") valley. Chinese Shan is also called Tai Mao, referring to the old Shan State of [Mong Mao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mong_Mao "Mong Mao"). Tai Long is used to refer to the Southern Shan State dialect spoken in southern and central regions west of the [Salween River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salween_River "Salween River"),[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_language#cite_note-4) the Northern Shan State dialect,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_language#cite_note-5) and the dialect spoken in [Laos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos "Laos"). There are also dialects still spoken by a small number of people in [Kachin State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kachin_State "Kachin State"), such as [Tai Laing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_Laing_language "Tai Laing language"), and [Khamti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khamti_language "Khamti language") spoken in northern [Sagaing Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagaing_Region "Sagaing Region").
